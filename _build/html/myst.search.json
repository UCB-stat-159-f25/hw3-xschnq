A way to visualize the frequency content of the data is to plot the amplitude spectral density, ASD.\n\nThe ASDs are the square root of the power spectral densities (PSDs), which are averages of the square of the fast fourier transforms (FFTs) of the data.\n\nThey are an estimate of the “strain-equivalent noise” of the detectors versus frequency,\nwhich limit the ability of the detectors to identify GW signals.\n\nThey are in units of strain/rt(Hz).\nSo, if you want to know the root-mean-square (rms) strain noise in a frequency band,\nintegrate (sum) the squares of the ASD over that band, then take the square-root.\n\nThere’s a signal in these data!\nFor the moment, let’s ignore that, and assume it’s all noise.\n\nmake_psds = 1\nif make_psds:\n    # number of sample for the fast fourier transform:\n    NFFT = 4*fs\n    Pxx_H1, freqs = mlab.psd(strain_H1, Fs = fs, NFFT = NFFT)\n    Pxx_L1, freqs = mlab.psd(strain_L1, Fs = fs, NFFT = NFFT)\n\n    # We will use interpolations of the ASDs computed above for whitening:\n    psd_H1 = interp1d(freqs, Pxx_H1)\n    psd_L1 = interp1d(freqs, Pxx_L1)\n\n    # Here is an approximate, smoothed PSD for H1 during O1, with no lines.

That’s OK, because the noise is so high below f_min that LIGO cannot sense gravitational wave strain from astrophysical sources in that band.\n\nThe sample rate is fs = 4096 Hz (2^12 Hz), so the data cannot capture frequency content above the Nyquist frequency = fs/2 = 2048 Hz. That’s OK, because our events only have detectable frequency content in the range given by fband, defined above; the upper end will (almost) always be below the Nyquist frequency. We set f_max = 2000, a bit below Nyquist.\n\nYou can see strong spectral lines in the data; they are all of instrumental origin. Some are engineered into the detectors (mirror suspension resonances at ~500 Hz and harmonics, calibration lines, control dither lines, etc) and some (60 Hz and harmonics) are unwanted. We’ll return to these, later.\n\nYou can’t see the signal in this plot, since it is relatively weak and less than a second long, while this plot averages over 32 seconds of data. So this plot is entirely dominated by instrumental noise.\n\nThe smooth model is hard-coded and tuned by eye; it won’t be right for arbitrary times. We will only use it below for things that don’t require much accuracy.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/losc-event-tutorial#plot-the-amplitude-spectral-density-asd","position":27},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"BINARY BLACK HOLE SIGNALS IN LIGO OPEN DATA","lvl2":"Binary Neutron Star (BNS) detection range"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/losc-event-tutorial#binary-neutron-star-bns-detection-range","position":28},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"BINARY BLACK HOLE SIGNALS IN LIGO OPEN DATA","lvl2":"Binary Neutron Star (BNS) detection range"},"content":"A standard metric that LIGO uses to evaluate the sensitivity of our detectors, based on the detector noise ASD, is the BNS range.\n\nThis is defined as the distance to which a LIGO detector can register a BNS signal with a single detector signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 8, averaged over source direction and orientation.  Here, SNR 8 is used as a nominal detection threshold, similar to typical CBC detection thresholds of SNR 6-8.\n\nWe take each neutron star in the BNS system to have a mass of 1.4 times the mass of the sun, and negligible spin.\n\nGWs from BNS mergers are like “standard sirens”; we know their amplitude at the source from theoretical calculations. The amplitude falls off like 1/r, so their amplitude at the detectors on Earth tells us how far away they are. This is great, because it is hard, in general, to know the distance to astronomical sources.\n\nThe amplitude at the source is computed in the post-Newtonian “quadrupole approximation”. This is valid for the inspiral phase only, and is approximate at best; there is no simple expression for the post-inspiral (merger and ringdown) phase. So this won’t work for high-mass binary black holes like GW150914, which have a lot of signal strength in the post-inspiral phase.\n\nBut, in order to use them as standard sirens, we need to know the source direction and orientation relative to the detector and its “quadrupole antenna pattern” response to such signals. It is a standard (if non-trivial) computation to average over all source directions and orientations; the average amplitude is 1./2.2648 times the maximum value.\n\nThis calculation is described in Appendix D of:\nFINDCHIRP: An algorithm for detection of gravitational waves from inspiraling compact binaries\nB.

It is the standard technique used by the gravitational wave community to find GW signals from compact binary mergers in noisy detector data.\n\nFor some loud signals, it may be possible to see the signal in the whitened data or spectrograms. On the other hand, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals or signals which are of long duration in time may not be visible, even in the whitened data.  LIGO scientists use matched filtering to find such “hidden” signals. A matched filter works by compressing the entire signal into one time bin (by convention, the “end time” of the waveform).\n\nLIGO uses a rather elaborate software suite to match the data against a family of such signal waveforms (“templates”), to find the best match. This procedure helps to “optimally” separate signals from instrumental noise, and to infer the parameters of the source (masses, spins, sky location, orbit orientation, etc) from the best match templates.\n\nA blind search requires us to search over many compact binary merger templates (eg, 250,000) with different masses and spins, as well as over all times in all detectors, and then requiring triggers coincident in time and template between detectors. It’s an extremely complex and computationally-intensive “search pipeline”.\n\nHere, we simplify things, using only one template (the one identified in the full search as being a good match to the data).\n\nAssuming that the data around this event is fairly Gaussian and stationary, we’ll use this simple method to identify the signal (matching the template) in our 32 second stretch of data. The peak in the SNR vs time is a “single-detector event trigger”.\n\nThis calculation is described in section IV of:\nFINDCHIRP: An algorithm for detection of gravitational waves from inspiraling compact binaries\nB.

Is is NOT an estimate of the actual (luminosity) distance, which depends also on the source location and orbit orientation.\n\nThese distances are at non-zero redshift, so cosmological effects must be taken into account (neglected here). Since we estimate the BH masses using the phase evolution of the waveform, which has been redshifted, our masses are themselves “redshifted”.
